# StreamForge  

StreamForge is a Go-based project that simulates a production-grade **real-time market data pipeline**. It ingests tick-level events through **Kafka**, processes and stores them in **TimescaleDB** for time-series queries, and uses **Redis** for caching and fast lookups.  

To make it closer to real-world systems, the stack includes a full observability layer with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **OpenTelemetry**, plus tracing through **Jaeger**.  

This project is designed as a **learning environment** to practice building scalable, event-driven backends with modern tools, while keeping the structure, tooling, and CI/CD setup aligned with professional engineering practices.

## Features  

- **Go backend** with clean project structure, CI/CD, and linting.  
- **Real-time ingestion** via **Apache Kafka**, simulating market tick streams.  
- **Time-series storage** using **TimescaleDB** for efficient queries.  
- **In-memory caching** layer with **Redis** for low-latency lookups.  
- **Observability stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, and Jaeger for metrics, dashboards, and tracing.  
- **Local dev environment** via Docker Compose with reproducible setup.  
- **Production-style practices**: Makefile tasks, pinned tool versions, GitHub Actions CI.
